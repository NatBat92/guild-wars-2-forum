# Guild Wars 2 Forum

Guild Wars Forum is a forum/ review app for enthusiasts of the guildwars franchise. The main goal of this app is to encourage players to talk about their favourite/ least favourite things in the game, show off their gear or share thoughts on up coming content.

A community can be created in the future with the possibility of creating and finding a guild for you to play the game with.

## UX Design and Planning

During the planning of this project, I considered which features and functionality should be available to the user, and how to provide these whilst maximising the user experience.

## Project Goals

A react frontend website and django backend API. Linked together to provide full CRUD functionality. 

A site that is accessed via login and provides users with the features of creating posts and comments and editing their profile. 

### The factors in setting these goals:

- Entry level knowledge and understanding of creating a React frontend and API backend.

### Project goals:

|No.|Goal|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|Log in/log out/Sign up | User can create an account and login or log out|
|2|Posts page styled with video games theme | A responsive homepage with post CRUD functionality|
|3|Comments | Comments for each post with CRUD functionality|
|4|Profiles (Created on new account) | Profiles with full CRUD Functionality |
|5| Front-end react website and custom built API| Hosted on Heroku |
|6| Deployment of final website to Heroku | Upon project completion | 
|7| Document all known bugs and issues | Ensure documentation is clear and honest |

## User Stories

An agile development strategy was implemented in this project as user stories were created as 'Issues' on GitHub. Each user story was listed and check boxes were used on ones which required multiple steps. Each time a task was complete i would tick the box until all steps were ticked off and i could resolve the issue.
